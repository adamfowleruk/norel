# NoREL API

Abstraction API for NoSQL non-relational document databases.

## Core API

The core API provides a complete abstraction of underlying NoSQL database configuration,
connection handling, and basic operations on a catalog (aka database) of documents.

Currently Document databases are supported. Other types of NoSQL database may be added in future.

## Design

The high level design can be read about in the [Design document](documentation/design.md).
